Welcome to py-opc's documentation!
==================================

**py-opc** is a python module that makes it easy to operate the Alphasense OPC-N2 optical particle counter using a Raspberry Pi over the SPI bus using either a SPI-USB converter or directly using the GPIO pins. It was originally designed using a Rapsberry Pi 2 Model B
and Python3.5; however, it should work on all variants.

There are a variety of OPC Models and firmware versions from Alphasense; a table documenting which ones are supported can be found in the complete documentation. If you own an OPC-N2 with a firmware version that has not been tested, please do so and submit as an issue on the GitHub repository.

Installation
------------

There are several ways to install py-opc. The recommended method is through the python package manager, ``pip``::

      >>> pip install py-opc [--upgrade]


If interested in testing a development version, clone (or download) the repository, navigate to the folder where the files are located, and install as follows::

      >>> python setup.py develop

If interested in developing, please visit the "how to contribute" page.

Requirements
------------

One of the following packages is required:

  * py-spidev_
  * pyusbiss_ (0.2.0 or greater)

.. _py-spidev: https://github.com/doceme/py-spidev
.. _pyusbiss: https://github.com/DancingQuanta/pyusbiss

Use the spidev library if you are planning to connect to OPC to the microcontroller via the GPIO pins.  Use
the pyusbiss library if connecting via a SPI-USB adapter.


Setting Up the Raspberry Pi
---------------------------

There are now two simple ways to connect your Alphasense OPC to a Raspberry Pi (or similar device): directly via the GPIO
pins, or using a SPI-USB converter.

Connecting via GPIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not familiar with setting up a Raspberry Pi to be used as a SPI device,
here are a couple of great tutorials: RPi_, Drogon_, and Hensley_. A few important things
to note:

  * The Alphsense OPC-N2 is a 3v3 logic SPI Mode 1 device
  * The OPC requires a ~1000 mA pulse to start and at least 250 mA to run, so powering through a GPIO pin is not an option
  * The OPC should be powered through the RPi or use the same power supply, to avoid SPI ground issues

To connect the RPi to the OPC-N2, there are four connections that must be made, plus ground and power. Use a
quality 5 VDC/2.5 A power source with the RPi for best results. The connections are stated below:

=====  ====================  ===== ==========
 Pin   Function              OPC   RPi
=====  ====================  ===== ==========
1      5 VDC                 VCC   5V
2      Serial Clock          SCK   SCLK
3      Master In Slave Out   SDO   MISO
4      Master Out Slave In   SDI   MOSI
5      Chip Select           /SS   CE0 or CE1
6      Ground                GND   G
=====  ====================  ===== ==========

.. _Hensley: http://www.brianhensley.net/2012/07/getting-spi-working-on-raspberry-pi.html

Connecting via a USB-SPI Converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect your OPC to the Raspberry Pi directly, you can use a SPI-USB converter. They can be found
fairly inexpensively online or directly from Alphasense.

You will then be able to directly connect the OPC to your Raspberry Pi's USB port.

Current Supported Firmware
--------------------------

There are several versions of Alphasense OPC-N2 firmware's that are currently deployed. If
you have a version that is not listed in the table or is not tested, please send a pull request
with your test results! The following versions have been tested:

Examples
========

Setting up the SPI Connection
-----------------------------

Using the SpiDev Library via GPIO Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

      import spidev
      import opc

      # Open a SPI connection on CE0
      spi = spidev.SpiDev()
      spi.open(0, 0)

      # Set the SPI mode and clock speed
      spi.mode = 1
      spi.max_speed_hz = 500000

Using the pyusbiss Library via USB Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

      from usbiss.spi import SPI
      import opc

      # Open a SPI connection
      spi = SPI("/dev/ttyACM0")

      # Set the SPI mode and clock speed
      spi.mode = 1
      spi.max_speed_hz = 500000

Initiating the OPCN2
--------------------
::

      try:
          alpha = opc.OPCN2(spi)
      except Exception as e:
          print ("Startup Error: {}".format(e))

Reading a Histogram
-------------------
::

      # Turn on the OPC
      alpha.on()

      # Read the histogram and print to console
      for key, value in alpha.histogram().items():
          print ("Key: {}\tValue: {}".format(key, value))

      # Shut down the opc
      alpha.off()
